## Backstory & Flavor

Lilithia was born in a forgotten village, where prayers faded and shadows lingered. When a wasting sickness claimed her family, no light answered, only something darker. In desperation, she turned to forbidden texts, believing she could save them. Instead, something else answered.

Her magic didn’t ignite, it slithered in.

Now, her power is a tether to something she does not fully understand. She casts not with awe, but with restraint, each spell a bulwark against the thing that hunts her. Every hex brings strength... and tightens the grip of her unseen patron.

She tells herself she’s still in control.  
But Pandora never blinks.  
And her dreams whisper truths.

---

### Signature Spell — Grim Tendrils

**Occult Tradition • Necromancy • Signature**  
**Range**: 30 feet (30-ft line)  
**Save**: Fortitude  

**Flavor**:  
Whispers. Pandora's unblinking eyes. Shadows spill like blood. From where her shadow misaligns, tendrils rip forth, not to cut, but to reveal. They expose regret, secrets, and unspoken guilt.

They are not shadows.  
They are judgments rendered in blood.

The strike is followed by a voice not belonging to either caster or familiar:  
"You are revealed."  
And then:  
"You are judged."  
What bleeds is not just the body.

---

### Spell — Fear

**Occult • Emotion • Fear • Mental**  
**Range**: 30 feet  
**Target**: 1 creature  
**Save**: Will  

**Flavor**:  
Lilithia does not threaten. She reveals. Her eyes, and Pandora's, pierce the soul. The target sees themselves as Lilithia sees them: flawed, pretending. The fear is not external. It is recognition.

---

### Spell — Void Warp

**Occult • Teleportation • Cantrip**  
**Range**: 30 feet  
**Target**: 1 creature  
**Save**: Fortitude  

**Flavor**:  
She blinks.  
Reality does too.

The target disappears and reappears—wrong. Their body feels out of sync. Their soul rebels. It wasn’t magic. It was misplacement. Something else shared space with them.

---

### Spell — Toxic Temptation

**Occult • Enchantment • Mental • Cantrip**  
**Range**: 30 feet  
**Target**: 1 creature  
**Save**: Will  

**Flavor**:  
Lilithia speaks not with voice, but through the hollow between truths. What the target hears are the things they most fear might be true. It’s not manipulation. It’s an unspoken permission. Doubt takes root.

---

## Social Dynamics

### Friendship

Lilithia doesn’t want friends. But she values survival and truth. Loyalty is shown, not spoken. She protects as she wished someone once protected her.  
"I do not like you. I stand with you. That is more."

### Admiration

She admires those who:

- Embrace pain without flinching  
- Speak costly truths  
- See the broken world and walk anyway  

She honors them by remembering their words, asking for true names, and sharing hidden truths.

### Enemies

She doesn’t hate. She judges. Falsehood is peeled away, cruelty examined, and vengeance delivered without spectacle. She removes the veil, and lets them see what hunts behind it.

---

## Group Dynamics (Organized Play)

Lilithia stays not out of loyalty, but necessity. The group is her last tether to what she was, before the dark thing took hold.

They are her anchor. Her reminder.  
Her proof that she is not yet alone.

"I do not need them to understand me. I need them to stand long enough to see what I see."

So she stays.  
She judges.  
She fights.  
And for a while—she remembers.
