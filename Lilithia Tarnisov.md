## Spell Details and Flavor

### Signature Spell – Grim Tendrils  
**Range:** 30 feet (line)  
**Save:** Fortitude  
**Effect:** Bleed and negative energy damage  

**Flavor:**  
Tendrils of darkness spill unnaturally from her shadow. They expose sin, regret, and unspoken guilt—not just wounds.  
"You are revealed."  
"You are judged."  

---

### Spell – Fear  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Save:** Will  
**Effect:** Frighten 1 (or 2 on critical failure)  

**Flavor:**  
She reveals what they try to hide. The fear comes from within—the recognition of their own falsehood.

---

### Spell – Void Warp  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Save:** Fortitude  

**Flavor:**  
She blinks. Reality distorts. The target reappears wrong. Something shared space with them.

---

### Spell – Toxic Temptation  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Save:** Will  

**Flavor:**  
She speaks truths unspoken. The target hears the fear they pretend not to have. Doubt takes root.

And that is what I reveal."

And she lets them see what hunts behind their own masks.

## Group Dynamics (Organized Play)

Lilithia stays not for belonging, but for survival. The party is her anchor.  
They are her tether to the girl she once was.

"I do not need them to understand me.  
I need them to stand long enough to see what I see."

So she stays.  
She judges.  
She fights.  
And for a time—she remembers.
