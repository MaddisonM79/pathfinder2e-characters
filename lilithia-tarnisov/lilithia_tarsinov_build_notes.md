### 📘 Source & Math

**Starting Scores:** All attributes begin at **10** ([*Player Core* p. 28]).

At level 1, characters receive **4 free ability boosts** and additional boosts from ancestry, background, and class:  
- **No ability may be boosted more than once** during the 4 free boosts ([*Player Core* p. 28]).  
- Boosting an ability score increases it by 2 if it’s 17 or lower ([*Player Core* p. 28]).

---

### ✅ Boost Breakdown

- **Ancestry – Human (Versatile Heritage)**  
  - **2 free boosts**: → **INT**, **WIS**  
    → ([*Player Core* p. 40], Human entry)

- **Background – Occult Librarian**  
  - **1 fixed boost**: → **INT**  
  - **1 free boost**: → **INT**  
    → Allowed per [*Player Core 2* p. 50] (Common Backgrounds)

- **Class – Witch (INT Key Ability)**  
  - **+2 to INT** from Key Ability ([*Player Core 2* p. 164])

- **Free Level 1 Boosts** (4 total)  
  - Applied to **STR, DEX, CON, CHA**

---

### 📝 Notes

- This array prioritizes **spellcasting (INT)** while maintaining generalist competence.
- **WIS** was already chosen via Ancestry, so **CHA** was selected from the Level 1 free pool.

## ⚔️ Core Stats & Combat

This section breaks down Lilithia's key combat and defense values, including AC, HP, Perception, Speed, Saving Throws, and Initiative. All values are calculated using Level 1 character creation rules from the Pathfinder 2e *Player Core* and *Player Core 2*.

---

### 🛡️ Armor Class (AC)

**AC:** 14  
**Formula:**  
`10 (Base) + 1 (DEX modifier) + 3 (Unarmored proficiency) = 14`

- **Wearing:** Explorer’s Clothing *(No AC bonus or penalty)*  
- **Proficiency:** Trained in Unarmored Defense  
  - Trained = +2 (Proficiency bonus) + Level 1 = **+3**

---

### ❤️ Hit Points (HP)

**Total HP:** 15  
**Formula:**  
`8 (Ancestry: Human) + 6 (Class: Witch) + 1 (CON modifier × 1 level) = 15`

- **Ancestry HP (Human):** 8  
- **Class HP (Witch):** 6  
- **Constitution Modifier:** +1  
- **Level:** 1

---

### 🧠 Perception

**Modifier:** +4  
**Formula:**  
`2 (Trained proficiency) + 1 (Level) + 1 (WIS modifier) = +4`

- **Witch Proficiency in Perception:** Trained  
- **Wisdom Score:** 12 → Modifier +1

---

### 👣 Speed

**Speed:** 25 feet  
- Human base speed, unaffected by armor

---

### 💥 Initiative

**Default Initiative:** +4  
- Initiative generally uses **Perception** unless otherwise specified  
- Same calculation as Perception  
- In some situations, Initiative may be based on other skills (e.g., Occultism) at GM discretion or with relevant abilities

---

### 🛡️ Saving Throws

| Save       | Modifier | Formula                                                            |
|------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fortitude  | +4       | 2 (Trained proficiency) + 1 (Level) + 1 (CON modifier) = **+4**    |
| Reflex     | +4       | 2 (Trained proficiency) + 1 (Level) + 1 (DEX modifier) = **+4**    |
| Will       | +6       | 4 (Expert proficiency) + 1 (Level) + 1 (WIS modifier) = **+6**     |

- **Witch Class Save Proficiencies:**
  - Fortitude: Trained
  - Reflex: Trained
  - Will: **Expert**

### 📝 Notes

- Lilithia’s focus spells form the backbone of her control and debuff playstyle  
- *Evil Eye* combined with **Cackle** creates consistent pressure in combat  
- She can only cast one focus spell per point, so managing her **Refocus** economy is key

## 🛡️ Saving Throws & Weapon Attacks

This section covers Lilithia's defensive saving throws and her basic weapon attack math. Each bonus is broken down by ability score, proficiency, and official source for Pathfinder Society validation and reference.

---

### 🧪 Saving Throws

| Save         | Bonus | Formula                                       | Proficiency | Source                              |
|--------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|

| **Will**     | +4     | 1 (WIS) + 2 (Trained) + 1 (Level) = **+4**    | ✅ Trained   | Witch Class – *Player Core 2*, p. 164 |

#### 🧾 Notes:
- All witches are **trained** in Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saves at 1st level.

---

### 🗡️ Weapon Attacks – Dagger

Lilithia wields a simple dagger for both melee and ranged combat. Its traits offer flexibility without armor penalties or restrictions.

| Weapon   | Mode     | Attack Bonus | Damage        | Traits                         |
|----------|----------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| Dagger   | Melee    | +1            | 1d4+0 P        | Agile, Finesse (STR for damage)|
| Dagger   | Thrown   | +6            | 1d4 P          | Agile, Finesse, Thrown 10 ft   |

---

### 📐 Weapon Math Breakdown

#### Melee
- **Attack Bonus:** `0 (STR) + 2 (Trained) + 1 (Level)` = **+3**  
  *(Note: Your earlier sheet listed +1; +3 is the correct melee bonus with Trained proficiency.)*
- **Damage:** 1d4 + **0** (STR modifier)

#### Ranged (Thrown)
- **Attack Bonus:** `4 (DEX) + 2 (Trained)` = **+6**  
- **Damage:** 1d4  
  *(Thrown weapons don’t add modifiers to damage unless specified)*

#### Weapon Traits:
- **Agile**: MAP is only –4/–8 on second/third attacks (instead of –5/–10)  
- **Finesse**: May use DEX for attack rolls (melee), but STR is still used for melee damage  
- **Thrown (10 ft)**: Can be thrown within that range; uses DEX for attack roll

---

### 📝 Notes

- **Will Save** is Lilithia’s strongest and most thematically relevant defense.
- The **dagger** provides reliable flexibility between ranged and melee without switching penalties.
- You are correctly applying DEX for ranged, STR for melee damage—excellent handling of finesse rules.

### 📦 Current Carried Gear

| Item                 | Bulk | Notes                                        |
|----------------------|------|----------------------------------------------|

| Explorer’s Clothing  | —    | Worn; no Bulk                                |

**Total Bulk:** ≈ **2.5**  
- Light (L) items = 0.1 Bulk each  
- 2 × L = 0.2 → Rounded down until 10 = 1 Bulk  
- Stored or worn items reduce impact on total carry load

---

### 🧳 Gear Placement

- **Belt:** Dagger  
- **Backpack:** Healer’s Tools, Writing Set  
- **Handy:** Component Pouch (attached for easy access)

- **Current Bulk:** ≈ 2.5  
- **Encumbered At:** 6 Bulk  
- **Status:** ✅ *Not Encumbered*

## 🐾 Familiar – Pandora

Pandora is not a pet. She is a shadow given purpose, a vessel of judgment, and Lilithia’s only remaining tether to anything that could be called companionship. Her form is that of a sleek, silent black cat with unblinking eyes and a shadow that moves of its own accord.

### ✨ Familiar Abilities (4 Chosen)

Lilithia selects **four familiar abilities** at Level 1:

| Ability           | Source                         | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Spell Delivery**| *Player Core*, p. 288          | Familiar moves and delivers touch spells on Lilithia’s behalf               |
| **Spell Battery** | *Player Core 2*, p. 165        | Once per day, recharges 1 Focus Point (triggers via nose-touch to Lilithia’s face) |
| **Darkvision**    | *Player Core*, p. 288          | See clearly in total darkness                                               |
| **Canny Acumen**  | *Player Core*, p. 288          | Uses Lilithia’s INT modifier for one skill (chosen: **Occultism**)         |

> *Spell Battery* is granted by **Lesson of Shadows** (Witch class feature). The other three are selected freely from the familiar ability list.

### 🧠 Behavioral Details (Roleplay)

- She does **not blink**, even when sleeping  
- She **pushes herself** between Lilithia and anyone attempting to touch her  
- She **emits a low, unnatural hum** instead of meowing  
- Her **shadow never matches her posture**  
- When Lilithia uses **Spell Battery**, Pandora presses her nose to her cheek—as if sealing a secret  
- She **stares silently at liars**, but never reacts directly

> Pandora is not a pet. She is the Watcher.
