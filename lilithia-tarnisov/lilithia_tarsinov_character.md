## 🕯️ The Whisper Beneath The Failed Prayer

Lilithia was born in a forgotten village, where prayers faded and shadows lingered.  
When a wasting sickness claimed her family, no light answered—only something darker.  
In desperation, she turned to forbidden texts, believing she could save them.  
Instead, something else answered.

Her magic didn’t ignite. It slithered in.

Now, her power is a tether to something she does not fully understand.  
She casts not with awe, but with restraint—each spell a bulwark against the thing that hunts her.  
Every hex brings strength… and tightens the grip of her unseen patron.

She tells herself she’s still in control.  
But Pandora never blinks.  
And her dreams whisper truths.

- She never blinks, even when sleeping.  
- When Lilithia sleeps, Pandora lays on or near her.  
- She doesn’t meow—only emits a low, unnatural hum.  
- Her shadow never matches her posture.  
- When using Spell Battery, she touches Lilithia’s face with her nose—like sealing a secret.

- Eyes reflect alien starlight—never blink

### Creed (Formal)

> "You are heard.  
> You are revealed.  
> You are judged.  
> What you are beneath your masks,  
> beneath your prayers,  
> beneath your hope—  
> that is what remains.  
> And that is what I reveal.  
> I bare you upon this world.  
> I bare you upon It for Its judgement."

### Reflections (Casual)

- "You are heard. You are revealed. You are judged."

---

## 🤝 Social Dynamics

### Friendship

Lilithia does not seek friends.  
But she recognizes useful bonds, and respects those who carry burdens of their own.

- Values competence and consistency  
- Loyalty is unspoken—she stands with you when it matters  
- Protects as she wished to be protected: without comfort, but with terrifying resolve

> “I do not like you. I stand with you. That is more.”

---

### Admiration

Lilithia admires those who:

- Embrace pain without flinching  
- Speak truths even when it costs them  
- See the world as broken, but keep walking anyway

She expresses admiration by:

- Remembering their words perfectly  
- Asking for their true name  
- Sharing truths others fear to hear

---

### Enemies

Lilithia does not rage. She judges.

- Enemies are examined. If false, they are *peeled open.*  
- She saves cruelty for liars and manipulators who harm others  
- If you harm someone she has claimed as “hers,” you are already being measured

She does not taunt.  
She does not warn.  
She removes the veil—and lets you see what hunts behind it.

---

### Group Dynamics (Organized Play)

Lilithia does not stay out of trust or kinship.  
She stays because they distract the thing that whispers to her.

They talk. They bleed. They shine.  
And for a time, that is enough to keep it quiet.

They are not companions. They are interference, useful noise that slows the dark.  
They do not see it, not yet. The way her shadow lingers too long. The way Pandora watches them sleep. The way her magic cuts deeper than it should.

They think she is strange.  
She hopes they never realize the truth.

> “I do not need them to understand me.  
> I need them to be loud enough that I cannot hear what’s becoming me.”

So she stays.  
Not out of hope.  
Not for redemption.  
Only because the end is patient.

She does not know what it is, or what it wants, only that it is inside her now, watching, shaping, waiting.  
It does not speak. It does not demand. It simply *is*.  
And every spell she casts, the tendrils tighten inside her a little deeper.

She doesn’t know how far she’s already gone.  
Only that something is being taken, quietly, irrevocably, and she no longer remembers what it was.

And though she knows no one can save her now,  
part of her still reaches, blindly,  
toward the only ones left who might notice the cracks.  
Not to rescue her. Not to bring her back.  
But to see her—the real truth—  
before the last piece of her is gone,  
and it is too late to stop It.
