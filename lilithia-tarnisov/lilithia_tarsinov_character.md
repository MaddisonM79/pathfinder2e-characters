## Spell Flavor & Themes

### Evil Eye (Focus Spell)
Not just a glare, but a moment where both Lilithia and Pandora stare in unison, unblinking. The target sees themselves reflected in those eyes—not as they fear they might be, but as they are.

### Grim Tendrils
Judgment rendered in shadow. Her patron does not speak, but others do—those she's marked. The spell lashes forward from beneath her cloak like living ink. It *clings* to the soul, not just the flesh, leaving victims feeling marked long after the physical wounds heal.

### Fear
They are not afraid of her. They are afraid of the part of them she reveals. The spell doesn't create terror—it pulls back the curtain on what was always there. Lilithia merely witnesses and exposes.

### Void Warp
Space folds around them. Reality skips, and when it returns, something is *missing*. Lilithia never moves—but they are no longer where they stood. Her gaze does not follow them. Her eyes were already there, waiting. The air where the spell activates briefly ripples like ink in water.

### Shield
Unlike traditional arcane shields of force or light, Lilithia's shield is a barrier of condensed shadow and will. Attacks seem to bend around her rather than being deflected, as though reality itself is protecting her.

### Message
When Lilithia casts message, recipients hear her words as though they originate from inside their own mind. Her whispers carry a subtle sensation of being judged, even when her words are neutral.

### Daze
The spell doesn't just stun—it forces a moment of terrible clarity. For an instant, the target sees themselves as Lilithia and The Unblinking One see them: naked of pretense, stripped of self-deception.

### Cackle (Hex Sustaining)
Not a jovial laugh, but a shared, mirthless acknowledgment between Lilithia and Pandora. As they lock eyes, a low, unnatural sound emanates from both of them simultaneously—part hum, part purr—and the hex tightens its grip.

## Familiar – Pandora

- **Type:** Cat  
- **HP:** 7  
- **AC:** Uses Lilithia's  
- **Speed:** 25 ft  
- **Senses:** Low-light vision, darkvision, scent  

### Appearance
- Raven-black fur with inky ripple texture that seems to shift in shadows
- Eyes reflect alien starlight—never blink, even when sleeping
- When she moves, there's a subtle wrongness to her motion

### Abilities
- **Spell Battery** - Stores a spell for Lilithia
- **Manual Dexterity** - Can manipulate small objects
- **Darkvision** - Sees perfectly in darkness
- **Spell Delivery** - Can deliver touch spells for Lilithia

### Behavioral Quirks
- She does not let people initiate touch with Lilithia. She pushes herself between them.
- She never blinks, even when sleeping.
- When Lilithia sleeps, Pandora lays on or near her.
- She doesn't meow—only emits a low, unnatural hum.
- Her shadow never matches her posture.
- When using Spell Battery, she touches Lilithia's face with her nose—like sealing a secret.
- She senses lies and stares silently at liars, but never acts on it directly.
- When someone lies, she stares unblinking until they stop talking.

### Connection to Lilithia
Pandora is not just a familiar but a manifestation of The Unblinking One's influence. When Lilithia and Pandora lock eyes, it's unclear who is communing with whom. There is a sense that Pandora sees through Lilithia, not just for her.

## The Whisper Beneath The Failed Prayer

Lilithia was born in a forgotten village, where prayers faded and shadows lingered. When a wasting sickness claimed her family, no light answe
